## Info

1. The boilerplate follows the old coding pattern of reactJS. For the test project, we can use this but at the time of development, we can implement latest coding pattern of  React 16.
2. We have not used quite a many things which we have found irrelevant for a test-project, like making use of several libraries, not so needed components and css.
3. We have not created real time front-end validation for now as the design for the logic screen does not suits front-end real time validation. At the time of real development, we can implement it in a more representation and user friendly manner.
4. The project right now in its current size and with provided information is not so modularize, at the time of actual development, we can work on strategies to decide the best ways to make the project more modularize with features like higher order components for error handling, separate wrapper, Auxiliary component etc.
5. We have not used pro-types for now as this is not a very must necessity for sole person in development and also not so important for test-task. if at the time of development, this is needed, we can add prop-types to our project components.
6. For now we have used cdn for bootstrap and images are not local, but at the time of development, we will put all these either locally or fetch them from our server.
7. The message on error we are receiving from the API is not looking nicer as it has special characters in it which is not so GUI friendly. For now we have used javascript string methods to do it but at the time of real development, we would suggest to make messages from the API more informative and GUI friendly.
8. For the sake of small test-project, we have not used any animation of any extra helpful library for graphical representations or anything else accept the needed ones.
